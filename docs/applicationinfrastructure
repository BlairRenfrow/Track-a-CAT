## Application Infrastructure Team Overview:

The Application Infrastucture Team will help define the under the hood elements of the Track-a-Cat application.  This group will work together to decide what the framework will look like for the backend of an application that may start small with a responsive map showing trolley stops and current trolley locations, but will one day scale to be able to support a number of features that have yet to be defined potentially including native mobile applications, sms interaction, multiple routes and bus types.  Cat would like to one day be able to use the data collected from the onboard location devices to determine things like actual stop time, expected stop time, average time between stops, etc.  

## Issues to Discuss:

* Initial Hosting Location
* Language and Framework for the Server/Application
* Database for collecting location data over time
* Potential Mapping Solutions
* API for receiving Trolley Location
* Other API Interactions i.e. Google Transit or MapZen for current traffic details 
* Long term environment RoadMap considerations
