## Pre-Event Roadmap 🛣️ Planning and Scope

DATE: Mon. May 8, 2017

LOCATION: CAT Conference Room

IN ATTENDANCE:

- Grant Sparks (CAT, SR. PLANNER)

----------

(Introductions first)

# 1. Project goals 📈 
## 1A. ‘Trolley’ fleet tracking (short-term)*
- Small victories to prove viability
- Political/financial feasibility, **not** primarily for tourists. 
- Beta test for larger implementation
- Need for scalability (see Code for Miami's solution on GitHub)
- Don't want to create monolithic solution that doesn't work for full CAT fleet in future iterations, iterative builds, open-source approach to implementation. 
- Don't reinvent the wheel - use existing solutions/infrastructure
  - Discussion of SMS: http://textmybus.com/
  - Mapping important, too: Code for Greenville or Code for Miami’s solutions.
  

***Trolley is in air quotes because it’s currently in limbo how the ‘downtown circulators’ will be rebranded by city in upcoming meeting.**

----------


## 1B. CAT's financial, organizational constraints
- Availability of funding immediately - shouldn’t be a problem, according to Sparks
- Discussion of funding sources - general CAT budget vs. SAMI
- Concerns/queries from CAT about this stage of project?


## 1C. Open Savannah's labor, time, mission-driven constraints
- Volunteers -- how to motivate
- Devs + designers + PMs
- Timeline
- Need for solution to align with Open Savannah's mission to improve quality of life for all residents, especially those most in need of solutions.


# 2. Event Goals/Structure ⚙️ 


## 2A. To design a solution that scales
- Not to build a working product by end of night.
- Feedback/user needs focus. What would users prefer? A map? SMS? 
-  Paper prototyping
-  Evaluation of existing solutions -- how can they be forked?
- Not the time or place for open discussion/complaints/suggestions about CAT service in general. Solutions-focused, not problems-focused.


## 2B. To get community involved, developers interested, recruit designers
-  Forming project team
-  Establishing an MoU (not on paper) with CAT


## 2C. Structure of event

Convene ~6:20 p.m.

- Welcome and brief overview of OS for newcomers (5 min.-Carl)
- Rapid introductions of everyone in attendance - Name, why here (10-15 min.)
- Statement of problem and current situation from CAT (10-15 min., Grant/Jorge/Brandon) 
- Statement of preliminary research and desired solutions from OS (10-20 min., Rob)
- Break into functional groups by area of project management to tackle (45 min-1 hour)
  - Let's list out areas of project dev. below:
    1. User Experience/UX (interaction, to map or not to map, user personas)
    2. Design (visual identity, color, interface, paper prototyping, mockups, name of service)
    3. Data Infrastructure (GPS>GTFS, JSON? Database? Server?)
    4. Hardware (cheap Androids? Arduino? Raspberry PI?)
    5. Research, documentation, 
- Reconvene as a full group, each group has one member report findings/discussion (30 min.)
  - Notes taken by INSERT VOLUNTEER(S) HERE and compiled into GH project readme.md
- Group non-verbal feedback in the form of ______  (Poll Everywhere?) (10-15 min.)
- Open floor for volunteers to help draft project roadmap (30 min.)


# 3. Longterm goals
## 3A. Scalability?

When does current contract expire? What will it take for it to be politically feasible to implement system-wide? Maintenance? Open discussion.


# Other input? Add below please.


## Two user segments:
